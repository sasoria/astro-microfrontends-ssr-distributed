# astro-microfrontends-server-islands

This demo takes advantage of Server Islands to do server-side composition of microfrontends. Each microfrontend is server-sider rendered
and fetches data from an external API.

## Features

- ✨ Server-side rendering of microfrontends
- 📦 Multiframeworks with Astro Server Islands (not tested)
- 🚀 SSG/SSR supported by Astro

## Usage

### Micro frontends

- Install dependencies for each micro frontend with `npm install`
- Start each micro frontend with `npm run dev`

### Shell

- Install dependencies for the shell with `npm run install`
- Start the shell with `npm run dev`
