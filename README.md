# astro-microfrontends-server-islands

This demo takes advantage of Server Islands to do server-side composition of microfrontends. Each microfrontend is server-sider rendered
and fetches data from an external API.

## Features

- ✨ Server-side rendering of microfrontends
- 📦 Multiframeworks with Astro Server Islands (not tested)
- 🚀 SSG/SSR supported by Astro

## Usage

### Microfrontends

- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Start each micro frontend with `npm run dev`

### Shell

- Install dependencies with `npm run install`
- Start the shell with `npm run dev`

## Disclaimer
This is running on a very experimental version of Astro that includes Server Islands. I recommend to wait for a stable release
of Astro Islands.
